# About

I'm a program developer, my name is Xu Jingxin.

I'm familiar with nodejs/ruby/php/swift/bash/lua, and created a web framework which named [sundae](https://github.com/sailxjx/sundae), a operation automation tool which named [sneaky](https://github.com/teambition/sundae). I was the main backend developer and team leader of jianliao.com, now this program [is open sourced on github](https://jianliao.com/blog/yu-ren-jie-kuai-le-jian-liao-kai-yuan-liao/).

I am currently working for [Teambition](https://www.teambition.com). It is a startup based in Shanghai that offers a SaaS collaboration tool.

I [write](/blog), [code](http://github.com/sailxjx), [paint](/paint). Feel free to get in touch with me via [sailxjx@gmail.com](mailto:sailxjx@gmail.com?subject=Hi).
