# The projects I likes (and reasons)

- [docker](https://www.docker.com/) Programmable configuration, active community.
- [couchdb](http://couchdb.apache.org/) Provides a REST API out of the box, consistent map reduce support.

# The projects I hates (but still using)

- [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) A mass of configurations, and you don't known what have they done.
- [heka](http://hekad.readthedocs.io/) Shiting documents, terribly keys and arbitrary format of configurations.
