# About

I'm a developer and my name is Xu Jingxin. I used to be a PHP developer, and now most of time I develop projects with CoffeeScript. It is an amazing and mystery language, if you are in the same way as I think, we may have a talk, perhaps we have a lot in common... In the left time I also coding in Ruby/ObjectiveC/Python/Shell and other thing else.

I have some interesting projects, most of them are hosted on github. [sundae](https://github.com/sailxjx/sundae) is lightweight restful framework based on express, it has some interesting features borrowed from rails, such as restful route declaration and hooks of actions. [graceful-logger](https://github.com/sailxjx/graceful-logger) is a slim log module written in CoffeeScript, it output colorful or timestamped logs. You can define the log format by yourself. The full list of my projects are listed on the [projects](/projects) page.

I am currently working for [Teambition](https://www.teambition.com). It is a project management tool, just like trello and asana.
